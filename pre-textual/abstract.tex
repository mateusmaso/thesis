\textAbstract{
  In order to embrace the rapidly transforming data needs of clients from distributed applications, it has been discussed more frequently new and efficient ways to expose data structures over services to client consumption. However, the current approaches of client-server communication has turned clients more dependent on data-flow implementation and architecture style of a server's API. This is because clients have to worry on writting code that directly access data structures, often leading to unwanted API coupling. To solve that, this project will study the usage of GraphQL query language as a solution for building a tool that helps clients to fetch and compose JSON data structures without worrying about reasoning on application interfaces. Allowing teams to constantly reason, experiment and perform data-flow API changes to lower response time and size, without causing impact on client-side code.
