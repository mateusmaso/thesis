  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    In order to maintain client-server communication efficiency without the need of versioning Web APIs, services have come across problems while performing changes on their specifications due to the coupling caused by the implementation of client's fetching code. Seeking to develop a solution for the coupling problem, this project conducts a study on the usage of GraphQL language and API description formats to propose a client-server communication model through automation in the execution of data queries. As a result, a tool foresaw by the model is developed to validate its applicability and guide client-side developers to the implementation of data fetching code independent of API specification. \\ \\
    \textbf{Key-words}: GraphQL. REST. JSON Hyper-Schema.
