  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    In order to embrace the rapidly transforming data needs of clients from distributed applications, new and efficient ways to expose data structures to consumption of a diversified amount of clients have been discussed recently. However, the current client-server communication approach has created dependency on data-flow implementation and architecture style offered by APIs. This is because, when fetching data structures, clients have to must on writing specific interface access code, often leading to unwanted coupling. To solve that, this project will study the usage of GraphQL query language as a solution for building a tool that helps clients to fetch and compose JSON data structures without worrying of reasoning and writing specific application interface code of one or more services. This strategy aims to cut response time and size without causing impact on client-side development. \\ \\
    \textbf{Key-words}: GraphQL. REST. JSON Schema.
